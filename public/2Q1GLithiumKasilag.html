            The TYRANNOSAURUS REX ("king of the tyrant lizards" in Latin), nicknamed the T-Rex, was a carnivorous dinosaur that lived around 66 million years ago, near the end of the Cretaceous Period. It is known from fossils found across North America dating between 80 and 66 million years ago (Rafferty, 2025). According to National Geographic (n.d.), it was a very large animal in both dimensions and weight, stretching to a length of 40 feet and weighing up to 8 tons. Although not speedy and only able to walk at around 12 miles an hour, the T-Rex was nevertheless a formidable predator, owing to its set of 60 sharp teeth alongside a strong sense of smell.

            One of the most notable attributes of this dinosaur was its powerful bite force, one of the most powerful in animal history. It is estimated that an adult T-Rex could chomp down with a force of up to six tons, enough to shatter and crush bone (National Geographic, n.d.). Although not as powerful as more mature members of their species, even young T-Rexes could deliver more than half a ton of force with their own bites (Sanders, 2025).
